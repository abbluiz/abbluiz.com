Me <a name="me"></a>

Hey, I am LABB, which stands for my real, full name. You can also call me Luiz! Besides being a software developer, I like writing tech-related articles, playing video games, watching movies & tv shows. And let's not forget listening to lots of music.

One of my passions is free and open-source software, and because of that I am the maintainer of [Privacidade Digital](https://www.privacidade.digital/), a Brazilian Portuguese website with digital privacy tool recommendations, translated and localized from the [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/) project. I'm also currently involved with other side projects you can check on my [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/portfolio/).

You can find me on the Fediverse at `@abbluiz@mastodon.social`. 

See you there! ðŸ˜Š

This website <a name="this-website"></a>

The idea of this website is to provide a simple, responsive, and effective way of showcasing my posts and projects. I've made it using Jekyll and some other tools ([details here]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/portfolio/labb-website/)). 

You can switch the website's language by selecting the `æ–‡A` icon (located on the top-right corner), then selecting the desired language, when available.

Most of the coding part is licensed under the [MIT license]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/LICENSE.txt). However, the content of most posts and some images will be licensed under something else (CC-BY-4.0 by default), so you should look out for that if you want to copy or modify my content (which is totally fine if you follow the license terms).
