Me
===

Hey, I am LABB, which stands for my real, full name. You can also call me Luiz, or whatever. Besides being a software developer, I like to write some tech-related stuff, play video games, watch movies, tv shows, and listen to lots of lots of music.

One of my passions is free and open-source software, and because of that I am the maitainer of [Privacidade Digital](https://www.privacidade.digital/), a Brazilian Portuguese website with digital privacy tool recommendations, translated and localized from the [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/) project. I'm also currently involved with other side projects you can check for yourself on my [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/portfolio/).

Oh, and you can find me on the Fediverse at `@abbluiz@mastodon.social`. 

See you there! ðŸ˜Š
