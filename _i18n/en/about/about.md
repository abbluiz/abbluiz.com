Hey, how are you?

I'm Luiz Antonio Bueno Barbosa (LABB), a software developer based on Canada. I used to live in Brazil though! I'm interested in many things related to IT, including, but not limited to: Security, Digital Privacy, Computer Networking, Programming, Web Development, Free Software... you name it. If I can learn at least one new thing about one of these subjects each day, I'm happy!

That's not all: you'll probably see me talking about games, music, movies, cooking... or anything that I find interesting really. I can change hobbies several times in a month!

One of my true passions is free and open-source software, as well as digital privacy. And because of that I am the main founder & maintainer of the [Privacidade Digital Initiative](https://www.privacidade.digital), a Brazilian-Portuguese website with digital privacy tools recommendations, translated and localized from the [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io) project. I'm also currently involved with other side projects you can check on my [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/portfolio/). Do you have a cool project you need help with? Send me a message about it!

You can find me on the Fediverse at [@abbluiz@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@abbluiz). I'm also in other places, but you can check that through the icons on the footer. 

Hope to see you soon!

I wanted to have this website to display my posts and projects in a very simple, responsive, and content-focused way. I've made it using Jekyll and some other tools ([check out all the details here]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/portfolio/labb-website/)). 

You can switch the website's language by selecting the `æ–‡A` icon (located on the top-right corner), then selecting the desired language, when available. I love to learn new languages, so when I feel comfortable enough with a new one I'll be adding more of them to the website!

You can copy the contents of my website, if you respect the licenses I'm using. All the code of this project is licensed under the [MIT license]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/LICENSE.txt). However, the content of most posts and some images will be licensed under something else ([CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) by default), so you should look out for that. I also use Font Awesome, which has icons released under CC-BY-4.0, fonts released under SIL OFL 1.1, and code under MIT.
