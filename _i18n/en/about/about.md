Hey, how are you?

I'm Luiz Antonio Bueno Barbosa (LABB), a software developer based on Canada. I used to live in Brazil though! I'm interested in many things related to IT, including, but not limited to: Security, Digital Privacy, Computer Networking, Programming, Web Development, Free Software... you name it. If I can learn at least one new thing per day about one of these subjects, I'm happy!

That's not all: you'll probably see me talking about games, music, movies, cooking... or anything that I find interesting really. I can change hobbies several times in a month!

One of my true passions is free and open-source software, as well as digital privacy. And because of that I am the main founder & maintainer of the [Privacidade Digital Initiative](https://www.privacidade.digital), a Brazilian-Portuguese website with digital privacy tools recommendations, translated and localized from the [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io) project. I'm also currently involved with other side projects you can check on my [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/portfolio/). Do you have a cool project you need help with? Send me a message about it!

You can find me on the Fediverse at [@abbluiz@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@abbluiz). I'm also in other places, but you can check that through the icons on the footer. 

Hope to see you soon!

I wanted to have this website to display my posts and projects in a simple, responsive, and content-focused way. I've made it using static website generator Jekyll with some other tools, including the Minima theme, Font Awesome icons, Liquid template language, HTML, CSS/SCSS, [and more]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/portfolio/labb-website/). 

You can switch the website's language by selecting the `æ–‡A` icon (located on the top-right corner), then selecting the desired language, when available. I love to learn new languages, so when I feel comfortable enough with a new one I'll be adding more of them to the website!

You can copy my website, if you respect the open-source licenses I'm using. All the code of this project, including example code that might be posted on the blog, will be licensed under the [MIT license]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/LICENSE.txt). However, the contents of the website, such as the written part of posts & pages, the images, data, etc, will be licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In certain situations, there might be other licenses being used in place of the ones I've described above. When this occurs, the different license will be clearly indicated in the source code, or linked in the post/page. An example of this is the utilization of the Font Awesome library. Although their icons are released under CC-BY-4.0 and their code under MIT, their fonts are released under [SIL OFL 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).
